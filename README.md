# CSS Color Schemes

Import a color scheme to you project. Don't care about the CSS and don't care about shades and color steps.

## Usage/Examples

```css
@import 'https://colors.distur.be/<scheme>/<color>';
```

### Scheme

`basic` *complete scheme*

This scheme outputs a complete configuration based on one initially spcified color.

`shades` *color steps*

This scheme outputs shades of the spcified color. This is especially useful for base colors.


### Color

Define your desired color as a hex value.
